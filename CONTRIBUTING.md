# Contributing

Hey y'all. I'm pretty chill about contributions.

- Please don't commit careless or trashy stuff.
- Please add tests for functionality you contribute.
- Tests should run, and the `CHANGES.md` should be updated.
- Please label your PRs properly, and assign them to yourself.
- Pull requests which do not align with the needs of managing promises themselves will not be accepted.
